# Topic Ideas

* [Tiny Clear](topics/tiny-clear.md) - create minimal ELF execuatables that clear the console, including scrollback, for all of the instruction sets officially supported by the Debian project as of Debian Bullseye (the current `stable` release at time of writing). The Debain Wiki [SupportedArchitectures](https://wiki.debian.org/SupportedArchitectures) lists several architectures and platforms and their support statuses - I'm interested in the 7 architectures with the **Supported** status, rather than **Unsupported**, **Unofficial**, **In progress**, or **Supported only through Buster**.

* [SIM Communication tracing](topics/sim-com.md) - monitor communication between cell phones and SIM cards when used for various day-to-day activities, and analyze a packet dump gathered with an Osmocom SIMtrace board (or a similar device), and see what communication occurs between the phone and the sim card ~~and look for info on what servers different mobile systems connect to, and how often.~~ Making sense of the structure of mobile networks has proven difficult for me, but it seems to me like the communication of interest would occur between the cellular modem and the network, with the SIM card used for authentication but not used to, for instance, encode packets to send, so my original idea would not work.
